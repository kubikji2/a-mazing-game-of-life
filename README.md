# A-Mazing Game-of-Life

Game-of-life implementation in C# using [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) to visualize the game-of-life evolution. The idea is to create a game-of-life implementation on an arbitrary grid that can be utilized in other Unity3D projects such as the planned game A-Mazing <something> (TODOD add reference).
